        You should have a string that is similiar to this: "Hello World my name is Lucycan Ly and I am 43 years old".
            whatever your string is, assign parts of them to 3 variables and use template literals to combine the variables.
            assign your img src to a varible and use the variable.

        Use a conditional statement to check if the paragragh element is truthy. It is truthy if it has text inside it. If it does have text inside of it, a log to the console will say "The paragraph already has text". If it does not have text it is falsy, this is where your string that you turned into a template literal will execute. Everything on your page should be the same. All you did was assign some variables used the variables and wrote a conditional statement.

        Continue to style your page however you like.
