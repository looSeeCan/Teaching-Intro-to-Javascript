    I had files all over the place, so I created some folders and organized acoordingly. I want to start from the variables_syntax
        and use the same example thru out the whole lesson, gradually evolving the example(s) as I go thru the lesson.
        
    Start on variables_syntax.... do all everything in the <script> tag for simplicity, finish all the pages, 
    come back and do the buttons in the index.html page > script, then show how to connect the src.
    give the assignment, talk about order of hierarchy for help.

    Thiking about using modules, but, that might be confusing. homework: rfp group to explain

OverView. Everybody's pretty new to these concepts, so, don't worry about trying to keep up. You can if you want to. 
We are gonna go thru some of these concepts more in depth, during the week. Im going to keep it as simple as I can so we can keep the lecture flowing. 
Questions out of scope. We can talk about it offline.
