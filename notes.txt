    I had files all over the place, so I created some folders and organized acoordingly. I want to start from the variables_syntax
        and use the same example thru out the whole lesson, gradually evolving the example(s) as I go thru the lesson.
    remember to side by side the window    
    Start on variables_syntax.... do all everything in the <script> tag for simplicity, finish all the pages, 
    come back and do the buttons in the index.html page > script, then show how to connect the src.
    give the assignment, talk about order of hierarchy for help.

    Thiking about using modules, but, that might be confusing.
     homework: rfp group to explain
     remember to talk about the dom

OverView. Everybody's pretty new to these concepts, so, don't worry about trying to keep up. You can if you want to. 
We are gonna go thru some of these concepts more in depth, during the week. Im going to keep it as simple as I can so we can keep the lecture flowing. 
Questions out of scope. We can talk about it offline.

    I did the Variables and Conditionals Day for the 13th. Imani was let go. So we lost 2 days of programming; Wed, and Thur.
    The assignment on the index.html page:
        I gave them an assignment of making an aboutMe page. The assignment on the first day was to  make an about me page which consisted of a button, paragraph and
        an img. When the button is clicked the paragragh and img is shown on the page.
        For Variables and Conditionals Day. The parts of the paragraph will be assigned to variables and will be used in a template literal. The img url will be assigned
        to a variable also. An if statement will be written: if (paragragh.innerHtml) {}
