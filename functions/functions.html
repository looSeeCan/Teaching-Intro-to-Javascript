        <h2>What is a function</h2>
        <h3>Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.</h3>
        <h3>You can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times.</h3>
        <h3>You can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce different results.</h3>
