        <h1>Variables, Syntax, Data types</h1>
        <h3>Mathematics - a quantity which during a calculation is assumed to vary or be capable of varying in value.</h3>
        <h3>Computing - a data item that may take on more than one value during the runtime of a program.</h3>
        <h3>Syntax - Syntax is the set of rules that define what the various combinations of symbols and words mean. This tells the computer how to read the code.</h3>
        <h3>Data Types: String, Boolean, Number, Null, Undefined, Object, Symbol</h3>

                // console.log(y + 5); console.log(x + 5); console.log(typeof (x + 5));

        ///variable declaration. Variables are containers for storing data. camelCase

        //When defining a variable that is meant to later hold an object, it is advisable to initialize the variable to null as oppposed to anything else.
        //that way you can explicitly check for the value null to determine if the variable has been fileed with an object reference at a later time.
        
        ///undefined
        //const y;//this declaration is not possible because the point of declaring an undefined is that you eventually want to define it. You can not define it in the future if it is a const
        //let undefined1;//a variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined. A method or statement also reyurns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an
        //console.log(x);//assigned value. A function returns undefined if a value was not returned. An example of undefined is that: a value might not contain a value and you may want to
        //use the password example for undefined
