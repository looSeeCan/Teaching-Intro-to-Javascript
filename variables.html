        <h1>Variables</h1>
        <h3>Mathematics - a quantity which during a calculation is assumed to vary or be capable of varying in value.</h3>
        <h3>Computing - a data item that may take on more than one value during the runtime of a program.</h3>
        <h3>Syntax - Syntax is the set of rules that define what the various combinations of symbols and words mean. This tells the computer how to read the code.</h3>

        console.log(string);
        

        //variable declaration. Variables are containers for storing data. syntax

        //string
        // const string = "Hello World";//keyword (const), identifier(string), assignment operator(=), value(Hello World), semicolon(they are read and used y the compiler to distinguish between seperate statements)
        //boolean
        // const boolean = true;
        //null
        // const null1 = null;//suggests that the variable is empty and  have a value later. Null will never be found anywhere unless a programmer specifically returned null
        // console.log(null1);
        //undefined
        // // const y;//this declaration is not possible because the point of declaring an undefined is that you eventually want to define it. You can not define it in the future if it is a const
        // let x;//a variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined. A method or statement also reyurns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an
        // // console.log(x);//assigned value. A function returns undefined if a value was not returned. An example of undefined is that: a value might not contain a value and you may want to
        //num
        // let num = 11;
        //objects

        //after all the datatype, log thenm to the console. talk about console.
        //template literals
        
        //console.log(string + ", the value " + num + " is not a " + boolean + " or " +  y + " data type.");
        //console.log(`${string}, the value ${num} is not a ${boolean} or ${y} data type.`);
